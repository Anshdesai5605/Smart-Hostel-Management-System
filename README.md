# Smart Hostel Management System

A modern, full-featured web application built using ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC. It provides a complete solution for managing a student hostel, from room allocation and complaints to mess menu planning. The system features two distinct roles: **Student** and **Admin (Warden)**, each with a custom dashboard and specific permissions.

Here is a showcase of the application's user interface and core features.

### 1. Admin Dashboard

## üöÄ Getting Started & How to Run

This project is built to be self-contained and easy to run. It uses SQLite, so no external database server is required.

### Prerequisites
* [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
* A code editor (like Visual Studio Code)
* A terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/SmartHostelManagementSystem.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd SmartHostelManagementSystem
    ```

3.  **Restore dependencies:**
    This command downloads all the necessary packages (like ASP.NET Core, EF Core, etc.).
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

4.  **Create the Database:**
    The project is configured to use EF Core Migrations to automatically build the SQLite database (`hostel.db`) and populate it with seed data.
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    *(If you get a `dotnet-ef` error, install the tool with: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`)*

5.  **Run the project!**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

6.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `https://localhost:7xxx` or `http://localhost:5xxx`).

## üîë Default Logins

The database is pre-seeded with two user accounts for testing:

* **Admin / Warden:**
    * **Email:** `admin@hostel.com`
    * **Password:** `admin`

* **Student:**
    * **Email:** `john@student.com`
    * **Password:** `password`

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Key Concepts

This application demonstrates several key concepts of modern web development:

### 1. Database (SQLite & EF Core)
* **What:** The project uses **SQLite**, a serverless, file-based database, which is perfect for development as it's just a single file (`hostel.db`) in the project.
* **How:** **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). This allows us to interact with the database using simple C# models (like `Student.cs`, `Room.cs`) instead of writing raw SQL.

### 2. Session State (Web "Shared Preferences")
* **What:** In ASP.NET Core, the equivalent concept to "Shared Preferences" for storing user-specific data is **Session State**.
* **How:** When a user logs in, their `UserId`, `UserName`, and `IsAdmin` status are saved in a temporary session. This "session cookie" is sent with every request, allowing the application to remember who the user is, show the correct navigation links, and secure admin-only pages.

### 3. Cache Memory (`IMemoryCache`)
* **What:** This is a high-speed, temporary storage location in the server's memory.
* **How:** To improve performance, the **"Today's Mess Menu"** on the dashboard is cached. The first time anyone loads the page, the menu is fetched from the database and saved in the cache. For all other users on the same day, the menu is served instantly from the cache, reducing database load and making the app feel faster.
